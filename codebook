Codebook
In addition to the descriptions below, the variable data follows a naming convention to ease understanding.  
Variables that begin with a “t” are time domain signals.  Those with an “f” are frequency domain signals.  
Variables that contain “acc” are from the accelometer, those that contain “gyro” are from the gyroscope 3-axial raw data.
Variables that contain “mean” have the mean of the variable in the relevant time period.  Those that contain “std” have the standard deviation.
Finally the last portion may contain an X, Y, or Z which indicates the axis measured.

tBodyAcc_mean_X, tBodyAcc_mean_Y, tBodyAcc_mean_Z
Means of the body acceleration data from the accelerometer X, Y, and Z axis respectively after passed through filtering. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.  Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.  The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

tBodyAcc_std_X, tBodyAcc_std_Y, tBodyAcc_std_Z
Standard Deviation of the body acceleration data from the accelerometer X, Y, and Z axis respectively after passed through filtering. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
